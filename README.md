# Semaphore Shortcuts
This chrome extension allows for shortcuts with SemaphoreCI. This was inspred by the tutorial corresponding with this repo [here](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/hack-keyboard-shortcuts-into-sites-with-a-custom-chrome-extension).

Primarily this copies the "sem rebuild pipeline <pipeline_id>" to your clipboard. You must be on a workflow run page for this to work. 


## Installation
1. Clone this repo.
2. Head over to Chrome Extensions (usually `chrome://extensions` in the address bar) and turn "Developer Mode" on the top left.
3. Click "Load unpack" and select the destination as the "src" folder of this cloned repository.
